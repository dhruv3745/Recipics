**AI Model Training**

The primary aim of this project is to utilize images for generating user-specific recipes. To achieve this, we developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze images and detect various ingredients. We explored several methods, including TensorFlow 2, but ultimately decided to split our approach into two main sections: creating a supervised learning dataset and training a YOLOv8 model.

**Creation of Ingredients Dataset**

Dataset: Ingredients 2.v2i.voc
Most existing datasets contain cooked meals, which donâ€™t align with our focus on identifying raw ingredients. To overcome this limitation, we created our own dataset of commonly used ingredients found in typical kitchens. We gathered over 300 labeled photos to form a custom supervised dataset, dividing it as follows:
* Training: 89%
* Validation: 7%
* Testing: 4%

**YOLO-NAS Object Detection Model**

After evaluating various options, we selected YOLOv8 for our model due to its proficiency in detecting multiple objects in images and its efficiency compared to TensorFlow.

The final CNN is fast at ingredient detection, achieving a precision score of 83.7%. To optimize load times on our Flask server, we hosted our model on Roboflow.

**Recipe Database Creation**

To find recipes based on available ingredients, we needed a comprehensive recipe database. While we initially considered using an existing API, we opted to create our own. Using MongoDB, we compiled over 30,000 unique recipes with 10 key parameters, adding an additional parameter to enhance search speed.

**Our Idea**

The app aims to provide users with recipes based solely on their available ingredients. Users can upload a photo of their ingredients, and the app will identify them, allowing for ingredient modifications and filtering by cuisine type, dietary needs, and health labels.

**Development Plan**

We followed a hierarchical development structure:
* Level 1: Pull data from the Recipe Search API.
* Level 2: Store and manage data in a MongoDB database.
* Level 3: Optimize data retrieval from the MongoDB dataset.
* Level 4: Implement computer vision for ingredient identification.
* Level 5: Integrate OCR to read receipts and map to ingredients.
* Level 6: Add user preferences for health needs and dietary restrictions.

**Challenges Encountered**

Aggregating a custom dataset was time-consuming, necessitating supervised learning due to limited images.
Our mapping algorithm sometimes yielded inconsistent results, affecting ingredient accuracy.
The AI model occasionally misidentified input images, leading to questionable accuracy levels.
